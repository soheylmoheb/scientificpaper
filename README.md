**TheFirstCode**
understands the paper and extract the model they are using. 
make sure you actually understand each paper (if needed use any OCR necessary or any visual analysis to understand the method)
I will need to write a project for my phd professor. 
1. explain the model in an understandable way. (write the formulas such that it can be copied and pasted into a simple .txt file)
2. write an algorithm for the Monte-Carlo simulation of the explained methods. 
3. write the python code for the same algorithm. 
4. find the best AI algorithm to predict the price of the internet for this specific model of pricing.
5. write the python code for this specific AI algorithm.
6. find the exact kaggle library whose data can be fed to this code to make predictions of the price. 
7. generate the result of the preivous 6 demands in a neat .txt file for each one of the pdf papers. 
8. also keep the result for each paper in your memory available so that i can use it later on. 

**#The Second code  will generate the final result now. #**
the code will need to receive a folder from my computer that contains the results from the previous code.
The folder is structured as follows: 
papers about: 
internet pricing (from 1990 to 2000) 
bandwidth pricing (from 1990 to 2000)
internet pricing (from 2000 to 2010)
bandwidth pricing (from 2000 to 2010)

inside each folder, there are folders named to the name of a scientific paper. 
inside each folder belonging to a paper, there will be 8 text files as follows: 


demand_01.txt:
Paper: [Paper_Title]
Demand 1: 1. Explain the pricing model proposed in this paper in an understandable way. Include any key assumptions and economic principles.
================================================================================
demand_02.txt
Paper: [Paper_Title]
Demand 2: 2. Write down all mathematical formulas used in the model, formatted so they can be copied as plain text (e.g., using LaTeX-like notation or plain text equations).
================================================================================
demand_03.txt
Paper: [Paper_Title]
Demand 3: 3. Provide a step‑by‑step algorithm to perform a Monte Carlo simulation of this model.
================================================================================
demand_04.txt
Paper: [Paper_Title]
Demand 4: 4. Write the Python code that implements the Monte Carlo simulation described in step 3.
================================================================================
demand_05.txt
Paper: [Paper_Title]
Demand 5: 5. Suggest the best machine learning or AI algorithm to predict internet prices based on this model, and justify your choice.
================================================================================Paper: A simulation study of usage-based pricing strategies for packet-switched networks.pdf
demand_06.txt
Paper: [Paper_Title]
Demand 6: 6. Write the Python code for that AI algorithm, including necessary data preprocessing steps.
================================================================================
demand_07.txt
Paper: [Paper_Title]
Demand 7: 7. Identify a specific Kaggle dataset (or library) that could be used to train the AI model, and explain how it relates to this pricing model.
================================================================================
demand_08.txt
Paper: [Paper_Title]
Demand 8: 8. Summarize the key findings of this paper in one paragraph, focusing on how the model differs from others of its time.
================================================================================


what I need the code to do is connect to DeepSeekAPI (secret code: sk-f73b59eca8334b2a8155e41ee1498f32 ) and MendeleyAPI (secret code: ufAs9cTMXOMzkG3X),
1) 
create a microsoft word file 
2)
use the headings feature, 
3)
create four main titles: 
internet pricing (from 1990 to 2000) 
bandwidth pricing (from 1990 to 2000)
internet pricing (from 2000 to 2010)
bandwidth pricing (from 2000 to 2010)

set these titles with heading 1. 

4)
then create subtitles (heading 2) with the names of the papers as follows: 
connect to the mendeley api and find the title of the paper in mendeley, and make a reference at the end of the title. 
then at the end of the paper when all the following commands are finished, the bibliography of the used papers from mendeley should be inserted at the end of the paper. 

5)
after the name of the papers: create subtitles (heading 3) for each paper as follows (instead of the description of all the 8 demands, write the following): 

a) Explanation of the pricing model proposed in this paper
b) mathematical formulas
c) step‑by‑step algorithm to perform a Monte Carlo simulatio
d) Python code that implements the Monte Carlo simulation
e) best machine learning or AI algorithm to predict internet prices based on this model
f) Python code for that AI algorithm
g) Kaggle dataset (or library) that could be used to train the AI model
h) key findings

6) 
then under each heading, the code should copy and past the exact contents of the text file with the following conditions: 

i) mathematical formulas: use microsoft word (insert→ symbol → equation) feature so that the formulas that appear linear, appear beautifully in a mathematical way
ii) codes: should have the .py highlighting feature. either use visual studio's feature to copy and past the codes so the codes have that feature, or use notepad++ and save the code with .py and then copy and past it copy text with syntax highlighting. or finally, if you know an easier way for the code to have syntax highlighting, do it like that. 
insert the codes, inside a text box in microsoft word and set it in the middle of the page. 

in a separate action after finishing the above, 
7) the code should read the all the text files only in the first part, and use deepthinking to create an introduction with 5 paragraphs, create a discussion section to provide kind of a comparision between the similar or opposing methods, and a then a conclusion with 3 paragraphs. 
then, for each one of the above three (introduction, discussion, conclusion) create a separate section in microsoft word. 
place introduction at the beginnning of microsoft word with (heading 1) feature, and past the pertaining text below it.
at the end of the paper, set the discussion and after it conclusion with (heading 1) feature and past the pertaining text below it
